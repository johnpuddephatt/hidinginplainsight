  - name: About this tour
    content: |
      This tour has been commissioned by the [Hyde Park Picture House](https://www.hydeparkpicturehouse.co.uk/) to increase an understanding of the cinematic history of Leeds, and to encourage and support the preservation of the cinemas that still survive, cinemas that are essential to our shared culture and community.

      Preserve cinema history by donating to the Hyde Park Picture House. [Donate Now](https://www.hydeparkpicturehouse.co.uk/donate/).

      The subject of cinema history in Leeds is vast, and we unfortunately can’t include all the details we would like. However, within the rich resources and archives that exist on cinemas in Leeds, there is often information about types of projectors, the projectionists, sound technology, and most importantly the memoires and recollections of the audiences themselves, that are all so important to the life and history of cinemas. Our continuing heritage projects will hopefully uncover more of these fascinating details.
      This audio tour is based on the Invisible Cinema Walking Tour, a commission by Conway and Young for the Hyde Park Picture House’s 100th birthday celebrations and designed by Ben Waddington. A special thanks also goes to Dr Laura Ager ([@doc_u_laura](https://twitter.com/doc_u_laura)), whose dedicated research, knowledge and cycling skills both inspired and laid the foundations of the tour.

      The tour was voiced by Leeds author SJ Bradley ([@BradleyBooks](https://twitter.com/BradleyBooks))
      Music by Faded Auditoria. You can also listen to and download the music used in this tour in full & for free. [Visit our Bandcamp page](https://hydeparkpicturehouse.bandcamp.com/).

      If you have any memories, photos, or Leeds cinema history you’d like to share with us, please email [info@hydeparkpicturehouse.co.uk](mailto:info@hydeparkpicturehouse.co.uk).
