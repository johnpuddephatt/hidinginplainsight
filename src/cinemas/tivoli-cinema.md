description: "This attractive 1,152 seat red brick cinema was designed by
  architect James Brodie, who also designed the Star, Corner House and Kingsway
  cinemas. In 1960 part of the building was being used for bingo but films were
  still shown until 1961, after which it became a Walkers Bingo, rivals of the
  Mecca empire. "

  People commenting on the Leodis website have mentioned a men’s barber shop
  inside at one time, and cinema historian Brian Hornsey discovered that in 1986
  snooker was being played here as well.


  In 2009 the Yorkshire Evening Post ran an article that read ‘Number’s Up for Tivoli’. “Manager Andy Wood locked the Tivoli Cinema doors for the final time on Sunday 22nd March, 2009” the article said.
