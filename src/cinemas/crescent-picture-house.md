description: Opening in 1921, the purpose-built Crescent cinema featured a large
  organ and an impressive 1158 seating capacity. Like many other cinemas, it is
  built on an incline, helping to create the large staggered auditorium without
  need of expensive excavation. The cinema closed in 1968 with a final screening
  of The Man Outside. The building remains in use as Winston's massage parlour.
