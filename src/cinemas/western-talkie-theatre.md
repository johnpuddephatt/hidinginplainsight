description: This small cinema was converted from a Primitive Methodist Chapel
  and opened in 1910. In 1933 it was renamed the Western Talkie Cinema, the most
  likely reason for this would be that it had installed a Western Electric sound
  system. It has also been known as the New Western and Branch Road Picture
  House. When it closed in 1960 it was converted to a bingo hall. It has also
  housed a launderette at one time, but is currently a European Food
  Supermarket.
