description: The Queen's Theatre was built in 1898 as a sizeable suburban
  theatre with seating for 3,500 patrons. It was a modern building for its time,
  with heating appliances, fire-proof floors and staircases, electric lighting
  and refreshment rooms. In 1924 it was converted into a cinema with 916 seats
  although it still hosted the occasional Cine-Variety show. It closed in 1957
  and the building was demolished in 1968.
