description: The Lyric Picture House opened in 1922 and had seating for around
  950 in the stalls and circle. It closed in 1976, reopened briefly and then
  closed again in 1977. New owners reopened it again in 1979 and it stayed open
  as a cinema until 1988, at which point it was operated by West Leeds
  Amusements Ltd.

  The building was sold at auction in 1992 with planning permission for either
  retail or warehousing, then later it became a church. 


  Hyde Park Picture House projectionist Allan Foster was a projectionist at the Lyric for several years. In September 2011, he and artist Lucy Skaer were given access to former cinema and they the got the projectors working again for an art-led piece commissioned by Pavillion. It was called 'Film for an Abandoned Projector'. The two Kalee 20 projectors had been left in place all this time and this type of projector was apparently manufactured in Leeds between 1947 and 1953, adding to the significance of the piece.


  The building is still visible but is now being used by a kitchen and bathroom manfacturer.
