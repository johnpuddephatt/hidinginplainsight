description: "The Scala was designed by Birmingham-based architects Essex and
  Goodman, who designed the Birmingham and Liverpool Scala cinemas. The building
  contained a ballroom as well as a cinema and the house band was the Charlie
  Marcus Band. In 1928 it was taken over by the Gaumont company. When it closed,
  the building was used as retail space: first as a furniture showroom, later a
  clothing store. It is currently an Easy Hotel."
description_extended: "'Scala' was a popular name for cinemas in the 20th
  Century. The one in Leeds was built for Sol Levy, a successful operator of
  super sized cinemas in other cities. The Scala opened in the same year as the
  Majestic, this was a 'year of super cinemas' for Leeds, although the Scala had
  fewer seats than the Majestic."
