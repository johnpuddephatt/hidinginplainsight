  auditorium seating 2,500 people. It had an orchestra, a restaurant and a
  ballroom, which hosted tea dances and evening dances. It was built on the site
  of the former recruiting office for First World War troops and it opened in
  1922. The domed ceiling of the auditorium was decorated with a great frieze
  depicting chariots and horsemen. "
