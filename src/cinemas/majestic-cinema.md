description: "The Majestic was Leeds' first 'super cinema' with a huge
  auditorium seating 2,500 people. It had an orchestra, a restaurant and a
  ballroom, which hosted tea dances and evening dances. It was built on the site
  of the former recruiting office for First World War troops and it opened in
  1922. The domed ceiling of the auditorium was decorated with a great frieze
  depicting chariots and horsemen. "

  The Majestic had an organ and a Symphony Orchestra, which was conducted by
  Francois Grandpierre.  The cinema changed hands several times while it was
  open, but in 1969 it was closed by the Rank Organisation (who had bought
  Gaumont-British in 1941) and the building was transformed into Majestic
  Bingo. 


  The building is now protected with a grade 2 listing, one of its heritage features is the 'marmo' terracotta tiling of its facade which was made by Leeds Fireclay of Burmantofts. 


  In 1993 it became infamous as the dance club Majestyk, which closed in 2006. A fire broke out in 2014 which destroyed the roof and put the building beyond use for some time. 


  It has recently been refurbished as an office complex and the building will soon be home to Channel 4's Northern headquarters.
