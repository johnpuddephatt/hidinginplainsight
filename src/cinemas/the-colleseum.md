description: The gothic-revival Coliseum opened in 1885 as concert hall with a
  capacity of over 3,000. In 1905 New Century Pictures converted it for film
  screenings, with a reduced capacity. The Gaumont organisation took it over in
  1928, making further changes. The cinema closed in 1961 and was used for film,
  TV, then inevitably, bingo. It was renovated as a music venue in 2001, and has
  remained so ever since.

  The Coliseum was the first picture hall to be licensed. A man called Sydney
  Carter first hired the theatre for a short season of projections, then he
  transferred his operation New Century Picture to the Assembly Rooms. Moving
  pictures were so successful there that he bought the freehold of the Coliseum
  and turned it into Leedsâ€™ first full time cinema. It was called The Gaumont
  from 1938 until 1961. The Gaumont was a bingo hall until 1969. We're not sure
  what happened to it during the 1970s and 80s, but it was back in action as a
  concert venue known as the Town & Country Club between 1992 and 2000, then it
  was Creation nightclub until 2007. Now the premises are known as the O2
  Academy.
