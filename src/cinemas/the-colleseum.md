description: The gothic-revival Coliseum opened in 1885 as concert hall with a
  capacity of over 3,000. In 1905 New Century Pictures converted it for film
  screenings, with reduced capacity. The Gaumont organisation took over in 1928,
  making further changes. The cinema closed in 1961, and was used for film, TV,
  then inevitably, bingo. It was renovated as a music venue in 2001, and has
  remained so since.
description_extended: >-
  It was a man called Sydney Carter who first hired the theatre for a short
  season of projections, then he transferred his operation New Century Picture
  to the Assembly Rooms. Moving pictures were so successful that he bought the
  freehold of the Coliseum and turned it into Leedsâ€™ first full time cinema. It
  was called The Gaumont from 1938 until 1961.
