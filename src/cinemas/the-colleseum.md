description: The gothic-revival Coliseum opened in 1885 as concert hall with a
  capacity of over 3,000. In 1905 New Century Pictures converted it for film
  screenings, with reduced capacity. It was the first picture hall to be
  licensed. The Gaumont organisation took it over in 1928, making further
  changes. The cinema closed in 1961, and was used for film, TV, then
  inevitably, bingo. It was renovated as a music venue in 2001, and has remained
  so since.

  The Coliseum was the first picture hall to be licensed. A man called Sydney
  Carter first hired the theatre for a short season of projections, then he
  transferred his operation New Century Picture to the Assembly Rooms. Moving
  pictures were so successful theer that he bought the freehold of the Coliseum
  and turned it into Leedsâ€™ first full time cinema. It was called The Gaumont
  from 1938 until 1961.
