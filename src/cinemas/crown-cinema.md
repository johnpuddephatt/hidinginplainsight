  Building of the cinema began in 1916, but the First World War delayed
  completion until 1919. According to historian Robert E. Preedy, the Crown was
  the second cinema in Leeds to feature sound or 'talkies', the first being the
  Rialto.


  In 2008 the derelict building was bought by Mr Arthur Cowie for rennovation purposes, with the intention to turn it into a manufacturing unit. He contacted us via this website and told us that when he acquired it, the former cinema had been used as a gym and "was in dreadful condition". 


  He had the decorative facade underpinned and its corners were rebuilt, but part of the top portion had to be removed for safety reasons. 


  He told us about a few more disoveries he made along the way: \

  \

  "When we removed the old sloping floor that was underneath the false floor, we found what looked like the remains of a cobbler's shop that would have been demolished prior to the cinema being built. The front steps are original and the old toilets by the rear exit are still below the floor level and walled in behind the false wall that carried the screen as are the wooden bellows and air boxes that fed the Organ."


  The organ was made by  Wood.Wordsworth & Co,  Hanover Organ works . Leeds.  \

  The extraction motor that was in the roof void for extracting the cigarette smoke was made by Flathers & C Ltd, Park Electrical Works , Leeds.
