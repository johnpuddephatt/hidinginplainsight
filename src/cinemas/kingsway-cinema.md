  The architect of this cinema was Pudsey-based James Brodie, who also designed
  the building that contained the Corner House cinema and the impressive Star
  'Super' Cinema on York Road. Once its days as a cinema were over, it re-opened
  as the New Vilna synagogue in 1959. A fire later closed it for good and the
  site is now occupied by flats.
