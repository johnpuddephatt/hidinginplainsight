description: "This ODEON multiplex, just outside Leeds, offers 1,117 seats
  across 13 screens. Before this cinema opened, Leeds had seen two previous
  ODEONs come and go. The ODEON Luxe cinemas started opening in the UK in 2017,
  these were existing ODEON cinemas that had been upgraded with luxury features.
  This ODEON was the first one in England to open with the upgrade. "
description_extended: ODEON is a very well-known cinema chain, not least for the
  modernist style of their iconic early cinemas. The first ODEON cinema opened
  in Birmingham in 1930 and the company expanded rapidly from there, building
  hundreds of cinemas in the UK. The firm was owned by Birmingham-based
  entrepreneur Oscar Deutsch until it was taken over by the RANK organisation in
  1938, who continued to use the brand. The ODEON chain is now owned by AMC
  Theatres.
