description: "The Star 'Super Cinema' opened in 1938, close to the site of the
  earlier Victoria Picture Hall. The architect was Pudsey-based James Brodie,
  who also designed the Kingsway cinema. There were two shops at the front, one
  of which has since been used a launderette. A sign on the side of the building
  advertises Thai kick boxing and martial arts and The House Of Prayer occupies
  the ground floor. "
