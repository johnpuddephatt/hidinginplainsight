description: The former Newtown Picture Palace is still visible on the corner of
  Bristol Street and Cross Stamford Street in Sheepscar. It opened in 1913 with
  788 seats in total, split between balcony and stalls. After its closure in
  1953 the building was used for warehousing textile goods. It is now open as a
  tile shop and retains some of its original plasterwork behind the false
  ceiling.

  Although it was quite a small cinema, it had its own orchestra, the Newtown
  Orchestra, which was led by Mr Francis Walker. This cinema specialised in
  showing Yiddish films and was situated in the heart of Leeds' first Jewish
  community.
