description: "The Malvern Picture Palace in Beeston was an unusual design with a
  mock tudor frontage. The architect was W.H. Beevers, who also designed the
  Hillcrest Picture House. It opened in 1912 with 850 seats and was known for
  having a clock with a neon pendulum above the main doors. It closed in 1971
  and sat derelict for a while until it was demolished.  "
