description: A modest sized cinema, The Lyceum could be found at the junction of
  Cardigan Road with Thornville Road. From 1913 to the mid 1960s The Lyceum was
  a popular suburban cinema with 708 seats. It became a Bingo Hall after the
  cinema closed. Now demolished, the Lyceum petrol station and minimarket now
  occupies the exact same plot.

  1968, the year in which The Lyceum closed, is an important year in cinema
  history. It was the year in which a new Gaming Act was passed by Parliament,
  this allowed more bingo clubs to be licensed. Bingo had hit peak popularity
  after the 2nd World War in Britain and as cinema audience numbers started
  dropping when more people acquired TVs at home, turning cinemas into bingo
  halls became a lucrative prospect.

  The Lyceum is fondly remembered in Leeds, it appears to have been quite distinctive during its heyday, especially for a nice fragrance inside the auditorium and a stripy canopy outside.
