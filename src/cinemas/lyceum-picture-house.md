description: A modest sized cinema, The Lyceum could be found at the junction of
  Cardigan Road with Thornville Road. From 1913 to the mid 1960s The Lyceum was
  a popular suburban cinema with 708 seats. It became a Bingo Hall after the
  cinema closed. Now demolished, the Lyceum petrol station and minimarket now
  occupies the exact same plot.
description_extended: >-
  This cinema is fondly remembered in Leeds, it appears to have been quite
  distinctive, especially for its nice fragrance inside the auditorium and a
  distinctive, stripy canopy outside. \
