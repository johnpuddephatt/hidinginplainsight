description: The Regent was designed by Leeds architect Fred Mitchell and opened
  in 1916. It seated 1,076 people divided between stalls and circle. By 1943 it
  was owned by Leeds and District Picture Houses, seating 866. It served as a
  cinema for 55 years until closing in 1971 and was converted into a bingo hall.
  The building is now home to Al Murad, a tile shop.
description_extended: >-
  When the cinema was altered for bingo, the screen was removed and a false
  ceiling added, but the walls and pillasters remained, as did a flat fronted
  balcony of approximately ten rows. The tile shop has since covered up these
  features with display areas. \

  It is possible to still see the original name Regent, which is painted on the roof. Apparently this was done for a publicity stunt in the 1930s. A plane flew over Burmantofts and did a leaflet drop advertising the cinema. The roof was painted so that the pilot of the plane could find it!
