description: "Opened in 1922, the Capitol Cinema and Ballroom Complex seemed to
  have been a rather large site, with the cinema said to have had 1,294 seats.
  After closure in 1968 it served as a bingo hall and has since been demolished,
  with the Meanwood Waitrose standing on the plot. "
description_extended: The text reading 'Picture House' on the Capitol cinema's
  facade is almost identical to that of the Hyde Park Picture House and various
  other sites, presumably coming from the same crafts person or The Leeds
  Fireclay Co. Ltd. (Burmantofts).
