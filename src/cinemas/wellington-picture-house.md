description: The Wellington Picture House, was situated on Wellington street,
  which runs down the left-hand site from the Majestic. This short-lived cinema,
  that opened in November 1920, was designed by Leeds based architect G. Fred
  Bowman and seated 693 people. It closed in 1941, possibly due to bomb damage
  during World War II, and has since been demolished.
