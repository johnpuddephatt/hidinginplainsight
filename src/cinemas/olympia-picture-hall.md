description: "The Olympia Picture Hall appears to have been converted from a
  chapel into a cinema in 1912. It had 390 seats and only lasted as a cinema
  until 1934. It has since been used as warehousing and sales space. Corrugated
  steel cladding now obscures the upper windows but the building is still in use
  as a Shisha louge and snooker hall, with a chip shop at the front. "
