description: The auditorium of Pudsey Picture House is still clearly visible on
  Church Lane, where it now houses a Sainsbury's Local store. When the cinema
  first opened in 1920 it was a one-screen cinema with 900 seats and an unusual
  front entrance. Two shops were built against the front of the building, one
  allegedly sold sweet and tobacco, the other was a clothing shop. These have
  since been demolished.
description_extended: After it closed in 1960, it has been a Fine Fare, a Co-op and a Kwik Save.
