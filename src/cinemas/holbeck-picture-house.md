description: "Opening in 1916, this 900 seat cinema had a 'bijou orchestra’ at
  every performance. Star Cinemas took it over in 1943. The cinema closed in in
  1962 and became the Silver Dollar Bingo and Social Club, then the building was
  used for a while by the Leeds Building Society (formerly Leeds and Holbeck
  Building Society). "

  Currently the front section is being used the offices for Holbeck Elderly Aid,
  rather touchingly renamed as ‘The Old Box Office’.
