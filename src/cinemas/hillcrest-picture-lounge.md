description: The Hillcrest Picture Lounge was a 1,131 seater cinema with its own
  orchestra. It was a handsome building built on the corner of Harehills Lane
  and Lupton Avenue, but as with many cinemas of its era, it closed in the 1960s
  and was demolished. The Leeds Driver And Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVSA) now
  occupies the site, in a new building called Hillcrest House.
description_extended: The architect of this cinema was W.H. Beevers who had also
  designed the Malvern Picture Palace in Beeston, several years earlier.
