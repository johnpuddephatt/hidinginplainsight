description: "The Pavilion was another of the many Leeds cinemas to have been
  designed by local architect J.P.Crawford. It opened in 1920 on Stanningley
  Road with 644 seats. It closed in 1970 and became the Star Bingo and Social
  Club for a time.  In the 1980s the derelict building was repurposed as
  offices.  "
description_extended: The Pavilion is now home to some new flats and although
  the building has changed substantially over the years, it has retained its
  distinctive frontage. When it was in use as a cinema, it was a destination on
  a major tram route into Leeds, it now finds itself on the route of the
  CityConnect cycle path from Leeds to Bradford.
