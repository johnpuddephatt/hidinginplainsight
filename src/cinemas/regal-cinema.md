description: "The Regal 'Super' Cinema was a handsome art deco-style cinema,
  built in 1936, which seated 1,500 patrons and provided parking for 400
  vehicles. It was owned by Goldstone Cinemas Ltd and there was a sweet shop
  concession called Stephensons at the front of the building. "
description_extended: >-
  The Regal was was designed by Leeds-based architect A. V. Montague, who also
  built the Rex cinema in Beeston. It was demolished so that a GEM store could
  be built on the site, this was an early a precursor of out-of-town retailing
  in the UK which later became ASDA.


  Many film goers recall combining a trip to the cinema with a visit to Coe’s Fisheries opposite and that the fish and chip shop often had long queues. Coe’s Fisheries is still trading on Crossgates Road.
