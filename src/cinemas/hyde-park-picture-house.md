description: The Hyde Park Picture House is a 275 seat cinema close to the city
  centre. When it opened in 1914 it was announced with a small advert in the
  Yorkshire Evening Post which described it as the “cosiest cinema in Leeds”. In
  1989 it was threatened with closure but was taken over by the Leeds Grand
  Theatre and Opera House Ltd, who still run it today. It is now a Grade II
  listed building.
description_extended: >-
  The cinema occupies the site of a former social club, built in 1908. It is
  unclear whether or not the cinema was adapted from that building or was a
  completely new build in 1914. In 1913, number 73 Brudenell Rd vanished and
  number 75 became the next building along after the social club/picture house.
  It looks as though a building there may have been adapted.


  The Hyde Park Picture House retains many heritage assets that you can still see today. Inside the cinema there are nine working gas lights, which are lit every day when the is cinema open. Alongside modern equipment in the projection room there are two restored Cinemeccanica 'Victoria 8' 35mm projectors, these date fom the 1960s and were previously installed in the Louge cinema. The ornate iron lamp pillar outside is also Grade II listed.


  You will now find that the former ticket office of the 1950s and 60s is a tiny shop that sells sweets, cakes and drinks. Going back to the cinema’s earliest years, that same space would have been occupied by a fireplace.
