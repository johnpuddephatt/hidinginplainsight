description: Opening in 1932 with a staggering 2,556 seats and a grand Wurlitzer
  organ, the Paramount Theatre was a glamourous addition to the Leeds
  cinemascape. The building is Grade 2 listed, made of red brick and Portland
  stone, topped by a balustrade and crowning urns. It changed its name to Odeon
  when the cinema chain, founded by Oscar Deutsch in 1930, bought all seven UK
  Paramount Theatres in 1939.

  Many people remember the Paramount for its deep carpets and snazzy staff
  uniforms. "You got two films, a stage show and of course, the organ" said K.W.
  Neale "about three and a half hours of pure entertainment". In 1963 and in
  1964 it staged concerts by The Beatles. It had various alterations made while
  it was an Odeon; its auditorium was twinned in 1969 and in 1978 a third screen
  was added, using space that had been the Paramount Restaurant. In 1988 the
  Odeon was refurbished and made into a 5-screen cinema, but it finally closed
  in 2001. The building is now a store, opening first as a Primark in August
  2005 and now occupied by Sports Direct.
