description: "Another cinema designed by Harehills based architect J.P.
  Crawford, this one had 594 seats and opened in 1912. The name was changed in
  1932 to the Western Talkie Theatre, no doubt when sound equipment was
  installed, and then again in 1954 when it was changed to Vogue and 'smartened
  up a bit'. "
