description: This impressive art moderne cinema opened in 1938, boasting a
  capacity of 1,836 patrons. The Clock Cinema closed in 1976, with a final
  double feature of The Incredible Journey and The Apple Dumpling Gang. Like
  many fellow ex-cinemas, it enjoyed a stint as a bingo hall. Thankfully, the
  building is still standing to this day, now split into offices and retail.
