description: Architect J.P. Crawford of Harehills designed many of the historic
  cinemas in Leeds, including the Strand Cinema in Holbeck, which opened in
  1931. At 1,166 seats The Strand was large enough to be called a 'super cinema'
  but in 1961 it too succumbed to the diminishing cinema audiences and closed
  down, reopening as a bingo hall. The premises have since been demolished.
