description: This is one of many cinemas in Leeds to have been designed by
  Harehills-based architect J. P. Crawford. At 850 seats and having no balcony,
  this was a fairly large cinema and after its closure in 1946 the building was
  used as a factory and a warehouse. It is still being used now as a tyre and
  MOT centre.
