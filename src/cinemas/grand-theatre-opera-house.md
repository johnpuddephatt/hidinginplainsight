  believed to have shown moving pictures, including Birth of a Nation. The
  theatre opened in 1878 and contains the Grand Assembly Rooms, a concert hall
  which seated 1,100. This was converted into a cinema by New Century Pictures,
  later becoming known as The Plaza - see separate listing. This venue is now
  called the Howard Assembly Rooms. "
