  Sheepscar. This 345 seat cinema opened at 136 Meanwood Road in 1913. In 1935

  called Kingfisher Lubrication took on the premises. "

  This was the second cinema in Leeds to have the name Atlas. When it opened
  there was another, larger cinema in Kirkstall already called The Atlas Picture
  House. Both cinemas were owned by John Newton Sharp.
