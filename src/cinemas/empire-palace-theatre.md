description: The vast Empire Palace opened in 1898, featuring a 1,700 capacity
  music hall. This hall was converted to screen films in the 1930s. Although
  much of the auditorium was demolished in 1962 to make way for retail space,
  the side entrance remains visible to this day. The site is presently occupied
  by Harvey Nichols.

  Unlike many of its peers, the Empire Palace continued to host variety acts
  until the 1950s. It was one of many Empire Theatres in the UK operated by Moss
  Empires Ltd.
