  music hall. This hall was converted to screen films in the 1930s. Much of the
  auditorium was demolished in 1962 to make way for retail space, however the
  side entrance remains visible to this day. The site is presently occupied by
  Harvey Nicols.

  Unlike many of its peers the Empire Palace continued to host variety acts
  until the 1950s. It was one of many Empire Theatres in the UK operated by Moss
  Empires Ltd.
