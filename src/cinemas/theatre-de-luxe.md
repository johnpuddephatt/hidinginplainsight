description: This cinema started out as a theatre, as many did in the first
  decade of the 20th century. It opened as a luxurious small picture theatre in
  1910, with just 383 seats. After 1934 the building appears to have been used
  as a clothes shop. Photographs taken in the early 1930s show the theatre
  sandwiched in between Lipton Grocers and Alexandra Cafe Tea Rooms on Kirkgate.
