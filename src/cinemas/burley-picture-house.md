description: Opened in 1913, the Burley Picture House was colloquially known as
  The Bug Hutch in reference to hygiene standards, though user recollections
  posted on the Leodis website appear to be largely favourable. The cinema could
  seat a very cosy 161 patrons and apparently accepted payment via washed glass
  jars for matinee screenings. It closed in 1959 and was shortly demolished.
