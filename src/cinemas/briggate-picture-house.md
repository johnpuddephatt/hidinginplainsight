description: Opened in 1911, the Briggate Picture House could seat around 600
  patrons. Initially it was host to stage plays as well as 'cinematograph'
  presentations. After a change of ownership in 1927 it became known as The
  Rialto. It closed in 1939, perhaps due to tough competition of the many other
  cinemas around Briggate.
description_extended: >-
  The site where the Rialto stood is now occupied by the central Leeds Marks and
  Spencer store. The firm purchased the plot in 1939 but with the outbreak of
  the War, the new building was taken over by the Ministry of Works. The store
  finally opened in 1951.
