description: Opened in 1911, the Briggate Picture House could seat around 600
  patrons. Initially it was host to stage plays as well as 'cinematograph'
  presentations. After a change of ownership in 1927 it became known as The
  Rialto. It closed in 1939, perhaps due to tough competition of the many other
  cinemas around Briggate.
description_extended: >-
  The Briggate Picture House was advertised as ‘The most luxurious
  cinematotgraph theatre in Yorkshire’,with two tea lounges, one decorated in a
  Wedgewood style for the use of ladies, the other in a Jacobean style for the
  use of gentlemen.

  The site where the Rialto stood is now occupied by the central Leeds Marks and Spencer store. The firm purchased the plot in 1939 but with the outbreak of the War, the new building was taken over by the Ministry of Works. The store finally opened in 1951.\
