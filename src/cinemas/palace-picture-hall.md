description: The Palace Picture Hall opened in 1912. It seems to have been
  briefly called Pictureland when it was owned by American Bioscope Co. Ltd. It
  was a conversion job, turning a former rollerskating rink into an enormous
  cinema during cinemaâ€™s boom years. It had 800 seats and also operated as a
  dance hall.
description_extended: >-
  Rollerskating reappeared here in 1929 when the popularity of the passtime
  revived, but part of the building was still in use as a cinema. When film
  screenings finally ceased in 1964 it went over to bingo instead, being known
  then as New Western Bingo. In the 1980s it was known as the Armley Amusement
  Centre. 


  A serious fire broke out in 2016. The fire started in what seems to have been a men-only sauna, the Steam Complex sauna (with overnight accommodation) which had occupied the building at the time. Planning documents in 2007 reveal that prior to the sauna being established there, this part of the building had been Armley Squash Club.


  It has now been demolished.
