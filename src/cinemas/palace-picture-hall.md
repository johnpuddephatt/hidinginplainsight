description: There is some contractictory evidence as to when the Palace Picture
  Hall opened, but it was between 1910 and 1912. It seems to have been briefly
  called Pictureland at this time too, when it was owned by American Bioscope
  Co. Ltd.. It was a conversion job, turning a former rollerskating rink into an
  enormous cinema during cinemaâ€™s boom years. It had 800 seats and also operated
  as a dance hall.
description_extended: Rollerskating reappeared here in 1929 when its popularity
  revived. When films ceased to be shown in 1964 the cinema went over to bingo,
  being known then as New Western Bingo. By the 1980s it was known as the Armley
  Amusement Centre. A serious fire broke out in 2016. The fire actually started
  in what seems to have been a men-only sauna, the Steam Complex sauna with
  overnight accommodation, which occupied the building. Planning documents in
  2007 reveal that prior to the sauna being established there, this side of the
  building had been Armley Squash Club.
