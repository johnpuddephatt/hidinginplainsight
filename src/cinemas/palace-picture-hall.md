description: The Palace Picture Hall opened in 1912. It seems to have been
  briefly called Pictureland when it was owned by American Bioscope Co. Ltd.. It
  was a conversion job, turning a former rollerskating rink into an enormous
  cinema during cinemaâ€™s boom years. It had 800 seats and also operated as a
  dance hall.
description_extended: Rollerskating reappeared here in 1929 when its popularity
  revived but part of the building was still in use as a cinema. When it ceased
  to show films in 1964 it went over to bingo, being known then as New Western
  Bingo. In the 1980s it was known as the Armley Amusement Centre. A serious
  fire broke out in 2016. The fire actually started in what seems to have been a
  men-only sauna, the Steam Complex sauna with overnight accommodation, which
  occupied the building. Planning documents in 2007 reveal that prior to the
  sauna being established there, this side of the building had been Armley
  Squash Club.
