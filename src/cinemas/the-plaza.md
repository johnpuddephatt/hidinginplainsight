description: The Grand Theatre's Assembly Room was built as a concert hall,
  opening in 1879, and could seat an audience of 1,100. Films were shown there
  from 1903 and after this, New Century Pictures leased the venue, which became
  a permanent cinema in 1907. From 1958 it was known as The Plaza.
description_extended: >-
  A newspaper at the time quoted that The Assembly Room was now open for
  'bazaars, concerts, public meetings, miscellaneous entertainments, and even on
  occasion dramatic performances.' Minor alterations took place in 1907 when it
  began to be used as a permanent cinema. With the advent of the motion picture
  the Assembly Room was substantially changed by the architect to suit its
  functioning as a permanent cinema in 1911 (and then disaster struck in 1923
  when a fire broke out in the projection box). The Plaza continued to present
  films there until its closure in 1985.\
