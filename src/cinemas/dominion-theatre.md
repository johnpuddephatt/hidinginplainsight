description: This large 1539-seat cinema opened in 1934, and included facilities
  for theatrical productions (such as changing rooms), though apparately they
  were rarely used. The cinema closed in 1967, entered bingo hall purgatory and
  eventually burned down. The plot has since been developed over.
description_extended: The cinema was likely named Dominion in reference to the
  adjacent streets all being named after Canadian cities (Montreal Avenue etc);
  Canada at that time being part of the British dominion.
