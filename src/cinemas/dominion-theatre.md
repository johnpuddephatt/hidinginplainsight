description: This large 1,539 seat cinema opened in 1934, and included
  facilities for theatrical productions (such as changing rooms), though
  apparently they were rarely used. The cinema closed in 1967, became a bingo
  hall and eventually burned down. The plot has since been developed over.
description_extended: The cinema was likely named Dominion in reference to the
  adjacent streets all being named after Canadian cities (Montreal Avenue etc);
  Canada at that time being part of the British dominion.
