description: Opposite the Scala on Lands Lane is the site of the Theatre Royal,
  which itself was built on the site of the Royal Amphitheatre, which burnt down
  in March 1876. Whilst was mainly used for plays and pantomimes, did also
  screen short films (apparently as early as the 1890s), as part of its
  extensive variety programme. It was demolished in the 1957, the same year as
  the Scala.
