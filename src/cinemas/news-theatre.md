description: "Opened in 1938, the News Theatre was part of the Queen's Hotel
  building. It has been known as The Classic, the Tatler News Theatre and the
  Cinema on the Square. Its cinematic life, however, ended in the 1980s when it
  became a nightclub called Planet Earth. It was boarded up in 2007 and appears
  to have lost its architectural pinnacle. "
description_extended: The Queens Hotel opened in 1937 and the News Theatre
  opened the following year, offering a newsreel service. In 1966 it became
  known as The Classic, but the name quickly changed to Tatler Film Club in
  1969. It was a notorious venue for watching soft-porn films and was frequently
  raided by police. The name reverted to The Classic in 1979, but it closed and
  became Planet Earth, then Bondi Beach Bar.  You can still see the original
  name News Theatre outside on the ground. There is an entrance that opened onto
  the station concourse which is now used by Bagel Nash as a service counter.
