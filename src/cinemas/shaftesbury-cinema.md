description: This is another of the many cinemas in Leeds to have been designed
  by J.P. Crawford of Harehills. It was one of his later cinemas, built in
  Art-Deco style. It opened in 1928 and had a capacity of 1,603 across stalls
  and balcony. According to one source it was fitted with 'the provision of wide
  chairs for two'. The building included a ballroom and row of shops along the
  side adjacent to York Road.

  The main auditorium of the cinema had a large stage. The Black Dyke band
  played there when it opened in 1928. Later it hosted performances by Cliff
  Richard and Gene Vincent. The ballroom opened in 1929. 


  Associated British Cinemas (ABC) owned The Shafstesbury from 1939 until it closed in 1958. It reopened as a casino in 1962 and the main auditorium was also used for bingo. It then returned to screening films in 1964 after being refurbished, but closed for good in 1975. 


  The main part of the building was used as a Sikh temple for a time and the ballroom became a nightclub known as The Starlight Bar. You can still see the facade, which is now used as a shop, but it has been somewhat obscured by footbridges that have been built across the York Road.
