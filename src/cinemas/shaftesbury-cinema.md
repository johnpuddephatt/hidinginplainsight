  The cinema had a ballroom which opened in 1929 and there was a row of shops
  along the York Road side of the building. The main auditorium also had a large
  stage and The Black Dyke band played there when it opened in 1928. Later it
  hosted performances by Cliff Richard and Gene Vincent.\

  Associated British Cinemas (ABC) owned The Shafstesbury from 1939 until it closed in 1958. It reopened as a casino in 1962 and the main auditorium was also used for bingo. It then returned to screening films  in 1964 after being refurbished, but closed for good in 1975. 


  The ballroom became a nightclub known as The Starlight Bar.
