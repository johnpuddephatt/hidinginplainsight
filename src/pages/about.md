With at least 80 cinemas once existing in Leeds and now only a handful remaining it begs the question: where have all our cinemas gone? The answer is, they’re all around us – you just need to know where to look!

### Presented by the Hyde Park Picture House, Hiding In Plain Sight is a new interactive heritage project, bringing together years of research with illustrations from Adam Allsuch Boardman – allowing you to rediscover the lost cinemas of Leeds.





From small neighbourhood picture houses to gigantic super-cinemas, so many of these incredible buildings remain in our lives today – repurposed into shops, clubs, offices – strangely familiar and hiding in plain sight. And for those that are no longer standing, their legacy lives on through the stories, photos and memories that so many of you have.

Supported by Leeds Inspired and the Heritage Lottery, this ever evolving archive will allow you to navigate the city and learn all about Leeds’ amazing cinema heritage. You can also submit your memories and photos of specific cinemas too, ensuring the project continues to grow over time.



From 14th August - 30th September, to celebrate the launch of Hiding In Plain Sight, we’re holding an accompanying exhibition with local independent bookshop Colours May Vary. The show will feature the brand new illustrations produced for the project, by Leeds-based artist Adam Allsuch Boardman. See our FaceBook event for more details.

Huge thanks to Adam, and the Hyde Park Picture House’s creative engagement officer Laura for all their work on the project. Thanks too, to Lets Dance agency for bringing the website to life, and to Leeds Libraries for contributing photographs from their amazing Leodis archive.
